## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Carbon Footprint Calculator project! This application is designed to help you calculate and manage your carbon emissions, allowing you to make more informed choices about your environmental impact. 

The project encompasses a login and signup system with email verification and password recovery. It calculates your carbon emissions based on inputs such as water usage, fuel consumption (petrol and diesel), electricity consumption, and even accounts for CO2 exhalation. The data is stored securely in the backend.

Additionally, you can visualize and compare your monthly CO2 emissions using graphs. You can also invite your friends to join the platform and compare your emissions with theirs. Furthermore, there is a section dedicated to carbon offsetting, where you can find ways to reduce your carbon emissions and contribute to environmental initiatives.
