          <p>
            Carbon offsetting is the process of funding projects that reduce or
            remove greenhouse gas emissions to compensate for oneâ€™s own
            emissions, in order to achieve a net zero carbon footprint.

            Carbon offsetting funds solutions to reducing carbon emissions now.
            Frequently carbon offsetting reduces emissions much faster than you
            can as an individual/single company. Carbon offsetting projects help
            to combat global climate change as well as caring for local
            communities. In many instances providing much needed employment,
            health improvement, biodiversity, reforestation and broad social
            benefits to impoverished communities.
